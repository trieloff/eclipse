# Midnight Noon

*A surf rock anthem for eclipse chasers*

---

## [Intro]
*[Surf guitar tremolo, drums kick HARD]*

## [Chorus]
*[Energy: Full, Anthemic]*
*[Gang vocals on responses]*

Midnight noon ignites the spark
*(Ignites the spark!)*
Far-flung spark returns the night
Chase my dark to see the light
*(See the light!)*
Newborn light crowns dying dark

## [Verse 1]
*[Energy: Driving, Relentless]*
*[Male vocal, raspy]*

The brawler dipped his brush in black
And painted shadow first, then flame
A shine means nothing front to back
Until the terror stakes its claim

## [Chorus]
*[Energy: Full, Anthemic]*

Midnight noon ignites the spark
*(Ignites the spark!)*
Far-flung spark returns the night
Chase my dark to see the light
*(See the light!)*
Newborn light crowns dying dark

## [Verse 2]
*[Energy: Building, Urgent]*

I packed my bags for Aztec dust
The shadow's path ran through the plains
Must leave behind what gathers rust
For heaven's crown and midnight's reigns

## [Bridge]
*[Energy: Soaring, Transcendent]*
*[Drums pull back, tremolo swells]*

The stars appear at midnight noon
Horizon bathed in shining light
Totality—the waiting ends
Endless minutes where shadow bends
I weep and weep and hold on tight
Become the sun, become the moon

## [Verse 3]
*[Energy: Raw, Desperate]*
*[Drums back HARD]*

Feet touched the ground, yet can't stay still
Next shadow's calling from the south
This restless beast won't get its fill
When burning hunger finds his mouth

## [Chorus]
*[Energy: Full, Anthemic]*

Midnight noon ignites the spark
*(IGNITES THE SPARK!)*
Far-flung spark returns the night
Chase my dark to see the light
*(SEE THE LIGHT!)*
Newborn light crowns dying dark

## [Verse 4]
*[Energy: Triumphant, Resolved]*

I seek the dark to taste the flame
I cross the paths that fate has drawn
The brawler taught me how to claim
The light that breaks at every dawn

## [Final Chorus]
*[Energy: Maximum, All Gang Vocals]*

MIDNIGHT NOON IGNITES THE SPARK
*(IGNITES THE SPARK!)*
FAR-FLUNG SPARK RETURNS THE NIGHT
CHASE MY DARK TO SEE THE LIGHT
*(SEE THE LIGHT!)*
NEWBORN LIGHT CROWNS DYING DARK

## [Outro]
*[Tremolo fading, drums drop]*

*(Midnight noon... midnight noon...)*
Chase the dark...
*(See the light...)*
*[Fade]*

---

*For all who chase the shadow across the Earth.*
